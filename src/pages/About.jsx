      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Evrett Godfrey. I am a junior programmer specializing in web design and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I recently completed the University of Sydney's programming bootcamp and have been working on a number of small projects, a selection of which can be seen on the portfolio page.</p>
      <p>I've always had an interest in programming, and since I've recently had the opportunity to study, I've been enthusiastically learning and experimenting in the field.</p>
      <p>One project I'm particularly proud of is the BarkMate project. While simple in design and scope, I feel it truly exceeds the original goals.</p>
      <p>I enjoy video games and frequently visit PAX. While I don't intend to move into video game coding professionally, I do hope to create fun projects related to gaming.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, I aim to enhance my coding skills and add more projects to my portfolio, with the goal of transitioning to a full-time role in programming and development.</p>
      <p>Please contact me via the contact page or use the details listed below.</p>
